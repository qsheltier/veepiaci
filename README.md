## Checksum Creation and Verification Made Easy

Planned features:
* Create checksum files containing a variety of currently-unbroken hash algorithm (e.g. SHA-3 and BLAKE3).
* Parse checksum files created by other software (e.g. [UltraISO](https://www.ultraiso.com/)).
* Verify checksums of arbitrary directory trees.
* Create verification reports.
